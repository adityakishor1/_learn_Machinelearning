# _learn_Machinelearning

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that involves the development of algorithms and models that enable computers to learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data. Instead of being explicitly programmed to perform a task, a machine learning model is trained on data, allowing it to identify patterns, make decisions, and improve over time as it is exposed to more data.
